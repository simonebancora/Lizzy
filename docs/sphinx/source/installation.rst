Installation
============

Lizzy is provided as a package. To install using pip, navigate inside the cloned `Lizzy` folder and run:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install .

.. tip::
    Since Lizzy is still in early development, package versioning is not adopted yet. Therefore, it is recommended to install the package in `editable mode <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#working-in-development-mode>`_.
