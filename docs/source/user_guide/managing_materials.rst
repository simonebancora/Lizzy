Managing materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The LizzyModel provides all relevant methods to create and assign any number of porous materials to the various mesh regions. The main methods to be used when performing material operations are :meth:`~lizzy.LizzyModel.create_material` and :meth:`~lizzy.LizzyModel.assign_material`. Under the hood, the LizzyModel is using the MaterialManager core component to perform these operations. We detail these functionality in the **Material operations** section.
