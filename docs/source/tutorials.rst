Tutorials
=========

We provide here a few tutorials to learn the basics of Lizzy. It is recommended to work through the tutorials in order, starting from the :ref:`channel_flow` case which is a minimal implementation of the solver. Mesh files used in the tutorials are available `here <https://github.com/simonebancora/Lizzy/tree/main/examples/meshes>`_.
